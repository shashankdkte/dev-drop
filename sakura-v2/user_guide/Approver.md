## What you can do as an Approver

- Everything a Requester can do (view and create requests, Report Catalogue, etc.)  
- View the list of **approvals awaiting your action**, per workspace and per type (OLS, RLS, LM)  
- View the list of **approvals you have already given**, per workspace and per type  
- **Approve or reject** one or more requests at once, with an optional reason  
- View **request details**, **history**, and **current approval state** (chain status)  
- View the **existing rights** of the user who created the request (within the selected workspace)  
- **Open Sakura from an approval email** and land on the right approval screen  
- **Set up delegates** (forward-looking, time-limited) so someone else can approve on your behalf

## View approvals awaiting your action

1. Sign in to Sakura (see [README](README.md#signing-in)).
2. Open **Approvals** or **Pending approvals** from the main menu.
3. Optionally filter by **workspace** and **type** (OLS, RLS, LM).
4. You will see a list of requests waiting for your approval.

![Pending approvals list – filter by workspace and type](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** This is your approval inbox. Acting on these requests keeps access decisions timely.

---

## View approvals you have already given

1. Go to **Approvals** (or **My approvals**) and switch to **Previous** or **History** (or the equivalent tab).
2. Filter by **workspace** and **type** if needed.
3. You will see requests you have already approved or rejected.

![Previous approvals list](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** You can review past decisions and follow up if needed.

---

## Approve or reject a request

1. From **Pending approvals**, click the request (or open it from an email link — see [Open Sakura from an approval email](#open-sakura-from-an-approval-email)).
2. Review the **request details**, **history**, and **chain status**.
3. Optionally view the **requester’s existing rights** in the workspace (if the UI offers it).
4. Click **Approve** or **Reject**.
5. If required, enter a **reason** (e.g. for rejection) and confirm.

![Approve/Reject with reason](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

6. You can also **approve or reject multiple requests at once** if the UI supports bulk actions — select the requests and use the bulk Approve/Reject button.

![Bulk approve/reject](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** Your decision completes (or advances) the approval chain so the requester can get access or be informed of rejection.

---

## View request details and chain status

1. In **Pending** or **Previous** approvals, click a request.
2. You will see **request details**, **history** (who did what and when), and **current approval state** (chain status).

![Request detail – history and chain status](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** Understanding the full chain helps you make an informed approve/reject decision.

---

## View requester’s existing rights

1. Open a request that is awaiting your approval.
2. Find the section or link that shows **Existing rights** (or **User’s current access**) for the requester in the selected workspace.
3. Review their current OLS/RLS access so you can decide in context.

![Requester existing rights in workspace](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** Seeing what access they already have avoids over- or under-granting.

---

## Open Sakura from an approval email

1. When you receive an approval email from Sakura, click the **link** in the email.
2. You will be taken to Sakura (sign in if needed) and landed on the **approval screen** for that request (or the pending approvals list).

![Approval email with link to Sakura](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** You can act on approvals directly from your inbox without searching in Sakura.

---

## Set up delegates

1. Go to **Delegates** or **My delegates** (or **Settings → Delegates**).
2. Add a **delegate**: the person who can approve on your behalf.
3. Set a **start** and **end** date/time so the delegation is time-limited.
4. Save. Your delegate will be able to see and act on approvals that would otherwise come to you.

![Delegate form – person and date range](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** When you are away, your delegate can keep approvals moving without giving them permanent approver rights.
