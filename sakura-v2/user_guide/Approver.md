# Approver Guide

This guide is for **Approvers**: users who review and approve access requests, manage delegates, and open Sakura from approval emails. Every step uses the **exact names and paths** you see in the Sakura app (left sidebar: **My approvals**, **Delegation**).

- **Approve or reject** access requests (e.g. per audience or app)

---

## View approvals awaiting your action

1. Sign in to Sakura (see [README](README.md#signing-in)).
2. In the **left sidebar**, click **My approvals**. The page title is **My approvals**; the description is “Review and approve pending access requests”.
3. The screen shows **Apps & Audiences**: requests grouped by app, then by audience. Each card shows **Workspace**, status (**Approved** or pending), and **Approve** / **Reject** buttons for pending items.
4. If there are no pending approvals, you will see “No pending approvals” and “You don’t have any pending approval requests at the moment”.

**Why it matters:** This is your approval inbox. Acting on these requests keeps access decisions timely.

## Approve or reject a request

1. In **My approvals** (left sidebar), find the **audience** or **app** card for the request you want to act on.
2. Review the **Workspace**, **audience name**, and **description**.
3. For a **pending** request, click **Approve** or **Reject**.
4. If the app asks for a **reason** (e.g. for rejection), enter it and confirm.

**Why it matters:** Your decision completes (or advances) the approval chain so the requester gets access or is informed of rejection.

## Set up delegates

1. In the **left sidebar**, click **Delegation**. The page title is **Delegation settings**; the description is “Assign delegates to handle your approvals when you're unavailable”.
2. In **Assign delegates**, enter the **Delegate email** (e.g. colleague@company.com) and choose **Delegate role** (which types of approvals they can handle).
3. Set **Start date** and **End date** so the delegation is time-limited.
4. Click the button to **add** the delegate. They will receive new approval requests on your behalf; existing requests stay with you.

**Why it matters:** When you are away, your delegate can keep approvals moving without getting permanent approver rights.

## Open Sakura from an approval email

1. When you receive an approval email from Sakura, click the **link** in the email.
2. You will be taken to Sakura (sign in if needed) and landed on **My approvals** or the relevant request.

**Why it matters:** You can act on approvals directly from your inbox without searching in Sakura.
