# Requester Guide

This guide is for **Requesters**: users who request access to reports or apps, view their requests, and use the Report catalogue. Every step uses the **exact names and paths** you see in the Sakura app (left sidebar and screens).

## What you can do as a Requester

- View the list of requests you have created (**My requests**)  
- View details, history, and approval status of your requests  
- Create access requests (OLS or RLS) via **Request access (Guided)** or **Request access (Advanced)**

---

## View your requests

1. Sign in to Sakura (see [README](README.md#signing-in)).
2. In the **left sidebar**, click **My requests**.
3. You will see a table of your requests. Use the search bar (“Search reports, apps, or workspaces…”) or the **All** / **OLS requests** / **RLS requests** tabs to filter.
4. Click a row to open **request details** (history and approval status). Use **Export** if you need to download the list.

**Why it matters:** You can see what is pending, who approved or rejected, and when access was granted.

## Create an access request

1. From the **Dashboard** (click **Dashboard** in the left sidebar), choose one of the two cards:
   - **Request access (Guided)** — step-by-step wizard via Report catalogue (for beginners).
   - **Request access (Advanced)** — direct workspace and object selection.
2. Follow the flow: select **workspace**, then app/report/audience as shown.
3. Choose whether the request is for **yourself** or **someone else** if the screen asks.
4. Complete any required fields (e.g. reason). For RLS, follow the workspace-specific steps (e.g. dimension selection).
5. Submit the request (e.g. **New request** or **Submit**).

![Dashboard – Request access (Guided) and (Advanced) cards](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** Submitting a request starts the approval chain. The right approvers (OLS or RLS) will be notified and can approve or reject.

> **Tip:** You can also start from **Report catalogue**: search for a report and use **Request access** on a report card when available.

---

## Use the Report catalogue

1. In the **left sidebar**, click **Report catalogue**. The page title is **Report catalogue search**; the description says “Search for SAR and AUR reports across all workspaces”.
2. Use the dropdowns (**All workspaces**, **All types**, **All access levels**) and the **search bar** to find reports.
3. Click a report card to see details. If the report is available for request, use **Request access** (or the button shown) to start a request.

![Report catalogue – search and results](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** The Report catalogue shows what reports exist and how to request them (SAR = single access, AUR = audience report).

---

## View your existing access

1. In the **left sidebar**, click **My access**. The page shows “View and manage your current access permissions”.
2. Use the filters: **All workspaces**, **All types**, **All access levels**. Use the **Search by name** box to narrow the list.
3. The table shows **Name & Type**, **Access level**, **Granted date**, **Status**, and **Actions**. Click a row or **View details** to see more.

![My access – table with filters](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** You can confirm what access you already have before creating a new request.

---

## Contact support

1. In the app, use the **bell icon** (notifications) in the header or any **Contact support** / **Help** link if your organisation has enabled it.
2. If you see “Help documentation coming soon!”, ask your workspace admin or IT for the right contact (e.g. email or service desk).

![Header with notifications and user menu](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** Support can help with access issues, missing workspaces, or request problems.
