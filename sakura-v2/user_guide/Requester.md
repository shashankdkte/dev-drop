## View your requests

1. Sign in to Sakura (see [README](README.md#signing-in)).
2. Open the **Requests** or **My requests** area from the main navigation.
3. You will see a list of all requests you have created.

![List of my requests – table or cards](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

4. Click a request to see its **details**, **history**, and **current approval state** (chain status).

![Request detail – history and chain status](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** Tracking your requests helps you see what is pending, who approved or rejected, and when access was granted.

---

## Create an access request

1. Sign in and go to the **Create request** or **New request** flow.
2. Select the **workspace** (and app/report if the UI asks).
3. Choose whether the request is for **yourself** or **someone else** (if allowed).
4. Complete any required fields (e.g. reason, report/app choice). For RLS, you may need to follow workspace-specific steps (e.g. dimension selection).
5. Submit the request.

![Create request – workspace and report/app selection](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** Submitting a request starts the approval chain. The right approvers (OLS or RLS) will be notified and can approve or reject.

> **Coming soon:** Some workspaces use a step-by-step wizard (e.g. by region: GI, EMEA, AMER). Those flows will be documented here when fully available.

## Use the Report Catalogue

1. Open **Report Catalogue** (or equivalent) from the menu.
2. Browse or search by workspace, app, audience, or report.
3. Use the navigation to drill into **Workspace → App → Audience** or **Report** details.
4. From there you can see what reports exist and how to request access (e.g. create request for a specific report).

![Report Catalogue – browse workspaces and reports](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** The Report Catalogue shows what is available and how it is organised, so you know what to request.

---

## View your existing access

1. Go to **My access** or **Existing access** (or the equivalent in your environment).
2. Select a **workspace** (and type: OLS or RLS if the UI offers it).
3. You will see your current access for that workspace.

![My existing access per workspace](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** You can confirm what access you already have before creating a new request.

---

## Request help (Help me)

1. In the request or support area, find the **Help me** button.
2. Click it and complete any short form or message.
3. Submit so that support or your workspace admin can assist you.

![Help me button and form](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

**Why it matters:** The Help me action sends your context to the right people so they can guide you or fix issues.
