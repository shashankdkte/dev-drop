## üìä Learning Tips

### React Learning Path:
1. **Master JavaScript first** - ES6+, async/await, destructuring
2. **Understand functional programming** - map, filter, reduce
3. **Learn React fundamentals** before jumping to frameworks
4. **Practice with projects** - Build real applications
5. **Learn Next.js** for production-ready applications

### Essential Resources:
- **React Documentation**: react.dev (new docs)
- **Next.js Documentation**: nextjs.org
- **React DevTools**: Browser extension for debugging
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for React development
- **TypeScript**: Add type safety to your React apps

### Practice Projects:
- Todo app with local storage
- Weather app with API integration
- E-commerce site with cart functionality
- Blog with Next.js and markdown
- Real-time chat application
- Full-stack SaaS application

### Performance Tips:
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper key props for lists
- Code split at route level
- Optimize images with next/image
- Use Suspense for better loading states
