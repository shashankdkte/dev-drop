3. **Focus on one stage** at a time
4. **Practice with projects** for each stage
5. **Review regularly** to reinforce learning

### Study Approach:
- **Theory + Practice**: Read about concepts, then implement them
- **Build Projects**: Apply multiple topics in real applications
- **Join Communities**: Discuss topics with other developers
- **Stay Updated**: Technology evolves, keep learning new developments

### Progress Tracking:
- Update your progress percentage for each stage
- Celebrate milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Review completed topics monthly
- Identify knowledge gaps and focus on them
