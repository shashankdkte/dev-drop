## üìä Learning Tips

### System Design Learning Path:
1. **Start with fundamentals** - Understand basic concepts before complex systems
2. **Practice with examples** - Design popular systems (Twitter, Netflix, Uber)
3. **Learn from failures** - Study outages and how they were resolved
4. **Think about trade-offs** - Every design decision has pros and cons
5. **Stay updated** - Technology and patterns evolve constantly

### Essential Resources:
- **System Design Primer**: GitHub repository with comprehensive guides
- **High Scalability**: Blog with real-world system design examples
- **AWS Architecture Center**: Cloud design patterns and best practices
- **Google SRE Books**: Site Reliability Engineering principles
- **Martin Fowler's Blog**: Software architecture patterns

### Practice Approach:
- **Start simple** - Begin with basic requirements
- **Scale gradually** - Add complexity step by step
- **Consider constraints** - Think about real-world limitations
- **Estimate numbers** - Back-of-envelope calculations
- **Draw diagrams** - Visual representation helps understanding

### Common System Design Questions:
- Design a URL shortener (like bit.ly)
- Design a social media feed
- Design a chat system
- Design a video streaming service
- Design a ride-sharing service
- Design a search engine
- Design a payment system
